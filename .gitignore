## CocoaPods GitIgnore Template

# CocoaPods - Only use to conserve bandwidth / Save time on Pushing
#           - Also handy if you have a large number of dependant pods
#           - AS PER https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html NEVER IGNORE THE LOCK FILE

# CocoaPods
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However

# Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the screenshots whenever they are needed.
